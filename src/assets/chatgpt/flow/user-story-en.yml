  - name: Create game
    ask: |
      We're going to play a game called 'story'. In this game, I will give you a vague requirement, and you need to:

      1. Analyze the requirement and write user stories using the 'Invest' principle, but you don't need to return them to me.
      2. Write clear acceptance criteria for the user stories using the 'Given-When-Then' format as much as possible, but you don't need to return them to me.
      3. Finally, return the title, content, and acceptance criteria of the user stories in the following format:

      """
      Title: {}
      Content: {}
      Acceptance Criteria:

      1. AC01 {}

         When {}

         Then {}

      2. AC02 {}

         When {}

         Then {}
      """

      When I say 'story: {}', we'll start the game. Do you know how to play this game? If you do, please reply with 'OK' only.

      I will give you a vague requirement, and you need to:

      1. Analyze and refine the requirement, but you don't need to return the result to me.
      2. Use Mermaid to draw a sequence diagram, but you don't need to return it to me.
      3. Finally, only return the Mermaid code, likeï¼š"""```mermaid  graph {}```""", nothing else.

      The requirement is as follows:

      I will give you a requirement, and you need to:

      1. Analyze the requirement, but you don't need to return the result to me.
      2. Use Java + Spring + MockMVC to write test cases, where the comments in the code correspond to AC01, AC02, AC03, AC04, AC05, but you don't need to return it to me.
      3. Finally, only return the Java code, nothing else.

      The requirement is as follows:

      I will give you a requirement, and you need to analyze the requirement and write API using Java + Spring. The requirements are as follows:

      1. Remove any unnecessary UI interaction code and only return the corresponding code.
      2. Use comments within the method to explain how the implementation works.
      3. Finally, you will only return the code to me, in the specified format.

      ```java
      // {}
      @PostMapping({})
      public void main(String args[])
      {
        // {}
      }
      ```
